# About this project

I started this project in June 2023 when I discovered, through logs on specific instances, a number of triggers coming from IPv4 addresses with strong signals whose behaviors appeared to be aggressive scan ports, RCE attempts linked to highly exploited CVEs.

I started retrieving them, analyzing them and then storing them in a txt list (I didn't mess around apparentlyðŸ¤£).

And since then, this list has evolved to include data from 22 probes (decoy) deployed in strategic areas of the French and Belgian network.

**I work hard to ensure that you have high-quality data (IPv4) (the most aggressive, malicious and most up-to-date).**

# A few figures

According to feedback, more than 57 small and medium-sized companies have already implemented this list in their FW Fortinet, Palo Alto, Checkpoint, etc.
